## Project Objective

The purpose of this repository is not to show my coding level, but to test my competence on **Version Control System (VCS)**, especially **Git**. Before uploading the project to GitHub, I saved my `.cs` file as “dont save”, so all the changes I made were lost. However, since I had already committed, I was able to successfully upload my files to GitHub and thus gain experience in using Git.

## Experiences and Development

This is my first time using Git and VCS, so I may have made some mistakes. During this process, I also got help from **AI** with the difficulties I encountered. I believe that my use of VCS will become more robust and efficient over time.
